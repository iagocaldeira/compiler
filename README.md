Compiler course I self study based on material from coursera

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to run any of the code in this depository, you will need to register
and follow instruction from coursera's compiler course; or you can follow
instructions I wrote here
(http://ryanandhuey.com/ryan/install-packages-for-compiler-course-project-on-ubuntu/);
last but not least, you can contact me, I will pack and send you a working copy
